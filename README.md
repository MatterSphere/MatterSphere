## Overview

3E MatterSphere is legal matter management software that embeds your client and matter information into Microsoft Office for increased productivity, greater visibility and improved client satisfaction. 3E MatterSphere revolutionizes matter management operations, from end to end, by providing firms with a single unified way to view and manage day-to-day activities including clients, cases, workloads, and all related documents and reference materials.

The whole of 3E MatterSphere can also be customised to match your firm’s business requirements, by simply making copies of the standard forms provided as core and manipulating them to meet your requirements, or by creating and managing your own forms. There are many modules incorporated into 3E MatterSphere; however, this guide just covers the standard core functionality.

3E MatterSphere is embedded into Microsoft Office, enabling users to create and view clients and matters, then link Word documents, Excel spreadsheets and Outlook emails, attachments, and appointments, to those clients and matters. Once Microsoft Office is connected to the 3E MatterSphere database, users are forced to save all their work through 3E MatterSphere linking them to a client/matter.

3E MatterSphere’s internal document management system controls updates and versioning of documents, along with an audit history of access to the document. The 3E MatterSphere database and users are set up in the Admin Kit. The functions in the Admin Kit include: (1) Create and maintain users and fee earners, (2) Set up the screens to be accessed by users, and (3) Set up the types of data that can be maintained.

The Admin Kit also contains an SDK to enable you to manipulate standard forms and develop your own.
